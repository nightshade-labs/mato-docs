# Foundational Concepts

To fully grasp the innovations and mechanics of TWOB, it's essential to understand the fundamental building blocks of decentralized exchange protocols. This chapter explores the key concepts that underpin modern digital asset trading, from traditional market making to automated liquidity provision. We examine how different trading mechanisms - including Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and Central Limit Order Books (CLOBs) - shape market dynamics, influence price discovery, and affect trader behavior. By understanding these core components and their inherent trade-offs, readers will better appreciate how TWOB addresses longstanding challenges in decentralized trading while introducing novel solutions for efficient, time-weighted execution.
