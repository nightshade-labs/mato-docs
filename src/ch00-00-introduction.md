# Introduction

Mato introduces a new type of order book that mitigates sandwich attacks and helps traders to efficiently execute large trades.

We call it the time-weighted order book, or TWOB (pronounced "tee-wob").

It works by streaming orders continuously over a time horizon set by the traders.
